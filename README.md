# 📱 CELLMART – AI-Powered E-Commerce Web App

**CELLMART** is a modern AI-powered e-commerce web application designed for a real-world mobile phone store based in **Piliyandala, Sri Lanka**. The system aims to enhance customer interaction and reduce store inefficiencies through natural language search and intelligent data handling.

> 📌 This solution is being developed as part of an SDLC-based academic project, with real implementation potential. The CELLMART shop has confirmed its willingness to adopt the system upon successful development.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Customers today often call or visit CELLMART to ask about product availability, models, or price ranges — creating unnecessary workloads for staff. To solve this, CELLMART will use **AI-based product discovery** to provide fast, intelligent answers to customers and reduce in-store pressure.

- 🖥️ Responsive, modern UI using **React** and **TailwindCSS**
- 📦 Accessory and mobile product listings with smart filters
- 🔐 Secure session handling and role-based access via **Clerk**
- ⚡ Fast, scalable backend powered by **Node.js + Express**
- 📡 Cloud-based deployment using **Vercel**

## 🧠 Why This Matters

- 99% of CELLMART customers still prefer in-store shopping — but often research online.
- Over 60% already use AI assistants, indicating readiness for AI-based features.
- The system will help reduce repetitive calls and boost staff productivity.
