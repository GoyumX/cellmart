### Additional Edge Cases and Test Scenarios for Comprehensive Testing Coverage

#### AI Search Edge Cases
- **Empty Queries**: Ensure the system handles empty search inputs gracefully without any errors.
- **Special Characters**: Test how the search handles special characters and whether it returns relevant results.
- **Network Failures**: Simulate network failures to see if the system can recover or provide meaningful error messages.

#### Authentication Edge Cases
- **Expired Sessions**: Verify that the system redirects users appropriately when sessions expire.
- **Concurrent Logins**: Test behavior when the same user logs in from multiple devices.
- **Password Validation**: Ensure that the system enforces strong password policies and provides feedback on validation failures.

#### Product Management Edge Cases
- **Duplicate Entries**: Check how the system responds to attempts to add duplicate products.
- **Invalid Data**: Test the handling of invalid data submissions during product creation or updates.
- **Bulk Operations**: Validate that bulk operations (e.g., bulk delete, bulk update) are processed correctly.

#### Reservation System Edge Cases
- **Double Booking**: Ensure the system prevents double bookings for the same resource.
- **Cancellation Workflows**: Test the cancellation process to ensure it is smooth and updates the system correctly.
- **Inventory Limits**: Validate that the system respects inventory limits when making reservations.

#### UI/UX Edge Cases
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Check that the application is fully responsive on various mobile devices.
- **Accessibility**: Test for compliance with accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG).
- **Performance Under Load**: Simulate high traffic to assess the application's performance and stability.

#### Security Testing
- **SQL Injection**: Validate that the system is protected against SQL injection attacks.
- **XSS Protection**: Ensure that user inputs are properly sanitized to prevent XSS attacks.
- **CSRF Protection**: Test that CSRF tokens are implemented correctly in forms and API requests.

#### Integration Testing Between All Components
- **Component Interaction**: Verify that all components interact correctly and handle data seamlessly across the application.

This comprehensive testing approach will help in identifying potential issues early in the development cycle.
